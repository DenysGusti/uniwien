/*
(+) A carpenter has a warehouse with boards in three types of wood (beech, oak and mahogany). All boards have the same cross-section, but are different lengths. If a board of a certain length is sold, if the corresponding length is not in stock, the appropriate length is simply cut off from one of the available boards. In order not to let the waste become too large, the shortest possible board should always be sawed up. Write a program to help the carpenter manage his stock. The following functions are essential: registering the current stock, buying boards of any length, selling boards of any length (the program should automatically suggest the shortest possible board), clearing up the warehouse (all boards that are shorter than a user-defined length are removed from storage).
