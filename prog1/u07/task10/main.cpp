/*
(*) Develop 2 functions for sorting an integer array using a "stable" and an "unstable" bubble sort method: The array is run through repeatedly. If there are 2 neighboring elements out of order (larger before smaller), swap them. As a result, the largest element is placed last on the first run, the second largest on the penultimate position on the second run, and so on. The elements rise like bubbles.

A sorting technique is said to be stable if records that have the same key value retain their original order after sorting.
Example: Sort the following data by family name
Franz Müller, Hermann Maier, Lieschen Müller
A stable sorting method must deliver the following sequence:
Hermann Maier, Franz Müller, Lieschen Müller
An unstable sorting procedure could also return the following sequence:
Hermann Maier, Lieschen Müller, Franz Müller
Caution: An unstable sorting procedure does not necessarily have to change the order. There must only be the possibility that, under certain conditions, the original order is not retained.
