(*) Write a function void sort(string& s) that sorts the characters in the string passed as a parameter. In the result, however, all vowels should appear first and only then the consonants. Under no circumstances should you sort more than once (for example, first find all the vowels, then sort them, then sort the remaining consonants and the two results are related). Example:
