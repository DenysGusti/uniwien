(*) Write a program to play battleships. It should be possible to set the position of the ships manually (the particularly keen ones can also try to do the positioning automatically, e.g. using random numbers; you can google for the functions rand and srand). You can then shoot at a field by specifying the coordinates. The computer should deliver the usual messages ("water", "hit", "sunk") and recognize when the game is over (when the entire fleet has been destroyed).
