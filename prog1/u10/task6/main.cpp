/*
Write a Link class whose elements represent links in a chain. A Link object contains a use value (double) and a pointer to a Link object. Write a constructor that takes a double as a parameter, sets the utility accordingly, and initializes the pointer to nullptr. Also implement an insert method that takes a Link object as a parameter and inserts it after the method's this object in the chain (i.e. the pointer in the parameter object takes the value of the pointer in this object and the pointer in the this object is set to reference the parameter object).
Note: In order for the insert method to work, the parameter object must be passed as a reference parameter! (why?)
