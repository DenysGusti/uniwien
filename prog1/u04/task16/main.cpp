(*) Write a function that takes two strings as parameters. Each of the input strings should contain a natural number in decimal notation. A string is to be returned that contains the result of the multiplication of the two numbers in decimal notation. However, the strings must not be converted into numbers; rather, the algorithm learned in school for multiplying two numbers must be implemented. (The function from task 15 can be used to implement the necessary additions.)

Check that this way you can correctly multiply much larger numbers than you can in the int data range.
