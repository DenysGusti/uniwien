Write a function that takes two character strings (char arrays) as parameters and checks whether and how often the second character string is contained in the first. The function should return the number of occurrences of the second character string found in the first one and also return in a reference parameter a pointer to the character in the first character string at which the first occurrence of the second character string begins (nullptr if the second character string is not contained ).
