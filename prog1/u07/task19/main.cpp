/*
(*) Design a data structure that you can use to represent the position in a chess game. Implement a 'position' function that can be used to position chess pieces on the playing field. It should receive a string, a boolean value and an object of your data structure as parameters. The string should be interpreted in the notation used in chess as the position of a piece (e.g. Ra7 corresponds to the rook on a7), the Boolean parameter should be interpreted as the color of the piece (white or black) and the data structure should be changed so that the piece is positioned accordingly. If the position is already occupied, or if the number of figures of this type on the field is too large according to the rules, an exception must be thrown (whether you want to observe the promotion rules or not is up to you). It is not necessary to check whether the resulting position is actually technically possible in the course of a real game.

Also implement a function 'move' that takes a boolean parameter (for black or white) and a position as parameters and returns all possible moves of the chosen color that capture an opponent's piece in the form of a vector of strings.
