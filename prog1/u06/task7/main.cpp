Write a function that takes a vector of double values and an additional double value x as parameters. The function is designed to rearrange the values in the vector so that all values less than or equal to x come first, then all values greater than x when looking at the values in order of ascending vector indices. Return the smallest index in the rearranged vector for the associated value that is greater than x. If there is no such index, a runtime_error type exception should be thrown. en: | Write a function that takes a vector of doubles and an additional double x as parameters.
