/*
Write a String class that can be used to represent strings of up to 80 characters.
Write

the necessary constructors so that the following definitions of objects are possible: String a; // creates an empty string
String b="abc"; // creates a character string with "abc" as content
The comparison operators == and !=, each of which compares the contents of two strings.
The + operator, which concatenates two strings (String("abc")+String("def")="abcdef"). If the maximum length is exceeded, the result must be truncated accordingly.
The - operator, which removes all occurrences of a character from the string (String("abcabc")-'a'="bcbc").
Write a main program that uses at least two instances of your class and illustrates the use of the different methods.
