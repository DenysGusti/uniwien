/*
(+) Implement a class Course to manage the participants of a course. Implement a constructor that can be used to set the title of the course and methods for entering names and matriculation numbers for the individual students, which are identified by a number (i.e. an index) assigned to them. It must be possible (via suitable methods) to save the results of assessments (i.e. points achieved in tests) for each individual participant and to calculate the average of the points achieved per person and per course. Note that not all students take every test. Define the output operator << to output a list of results for the entire course.

A suitable test program must be created to test the class.
