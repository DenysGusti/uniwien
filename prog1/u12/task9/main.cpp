/*
Quaternions are algebraic objects similar to complex numbers. However, quaternions consist of four components instead of two. They are written in the form a+bi+cj+dk. The following formulas apply to multiplication:
i*i=j*j=k*k=-1
i*j=k
i*k=-j
ji=-k
j*k=i
ki=j
k*j=-i
Note that multiplication is not commutative. Implement a Quaternion class with the +,- and * operators and a print method for formatted output.
