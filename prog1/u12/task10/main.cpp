/*
Implement a Polygon class that can be used to represent polygons in three-dimensional space. Internally, use a list of vertices of the polygon, each edge going from one point to its descendant in the list. In this context, the starting point is the successor of the last point, resulting in a closed, geometric figure. Implement the following methods (the necessary parameters and types of return values ​​are to be considered by yourself):
add //Add an additional vertex
zoom //Enlarge or reduce the entire figure by a specified factor
translation //Move the entire figure by a given vector
==, != //comparison operators. Two polygons are equal if and only if they contain the same points and edges. However, the starting point is not important.
Example of equality for polygons: (1 0 0) - (0 1 0) - (0 0 1) == (0 1 0) - (0 0 1) - (1 0 0) != (0 1 0) - (1 0 0) - (0 0 1)
