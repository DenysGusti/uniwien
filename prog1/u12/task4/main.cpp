/*
(+) A basic robot has three sensors that tell it whether it is touching a wall with its left, front, or right side. The robot can perform the following actions: rotate 90 degrees left, rotate 90 degrees right, and move forward one length unit. The robot is programmed by writing what actions to perform in that state in a list of 8 entries, each corresponding to a possible overall state of all three sensors. A rotation and/or a forward movement can take place in each case. So for example: free left, free front and free right causes a rotation to the left and a step forward. Write a Labyrinth class that can contain empty cells and walls in a two-dimensional field and that allows the Robot class to determine the appropriate sensor values ​​depending on a current position and orientation. Write a Robot class that allows the robot to be programmed and started anywhere in the maze. Can you program the robot to find its way through any maze?
