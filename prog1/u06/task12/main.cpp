/*
Write a function that takes an array of strings as a parameter. The strings contain the times achieved in a competition, sorted by starting number (index 0 is the time of starting number 1, etc.). Times are presented in minutes:seconds:thousandths format (e.g.: 4:20:216 for 4 minutes 20,216 seconds). The function should return the start number of the winner and, in an additional reference parameter, the time differences to the winner for all participants. In the event that there are several winners, or one of the strings received is not a legal representation of a time, an exception of type runtime_error must be thrown. E.g.:
Input Vector {"1:10:223", "1:5:223", "1:7:403", "1:8:273", "1:6:233"}
Return value: 2 Vector of time differences: {5, 0, 2.18, 3.05, 1.01}
