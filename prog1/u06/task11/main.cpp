/*
Write a function to calculate the amount of tax due, taking into account the progression. The function receives the profit as a parameter, as well as a vector with range limits and another vector with associated tax rates and returns the amount to be paid. If the input vectors are faulty (the number of entries does not match or the area limits are not sorted in ascending order), an exception of type runtime_error must be thrown. The current tax rates for Austria can be found in the following table:
von         bis         Prozentsatz
0           11000       0
11000.01    18000       25
18000.01    31000       35
31000.01    60000       42
60000.01    90000       48
90000.01    10000
