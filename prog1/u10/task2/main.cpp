/*
Write a function that takes two arrays of int values ​​and their respective lengths (number of elements stored) as parameters and removes all elements from the first array that are multiples of an entry from the second array. (Note that there are no empty positions in an array, so the gap left by the deletion must be closed by appropriately moving the remaining elements.) The function should return the new length of the first array (i.e. the number of remaining elements).
