/*
Test series are carried out as part of an experiment. The result of each test series is a vector of measured integer values. All results are summarized in a vector of type vector<vector<int>>, each element of which contains a test set result. For the statistical analysis, it is necessary to divide the numbers into groups in such a way that only numbers of the same order of magnitude (with the same number of decimal places) are in each group. To do this, write a function that takes a parameter of type vector<vector<int>> and rearranges the numbers so that all one-digit numbers are in the first element of the vector, all two-digit numbers are in the second, etc. (groups containing no elements can be ignored. The order of the numbers in the individual groups is not important) The function should return a vector of double values ​​containing the mean values ​​of the groups as return value. E.g.:
Test set 1: 5 12 2430 1 17
Test set 2: 5219 22 9 12
Test set 3: 7 9 18 4231

rearranged vector : {{5, 1, 9, 7, 9}, {12, 17, 22, 12, 18}, {2430, 5219, 4231}}
Return value: {6.2, 16.2, 3960}
