/*
Write a function that takes two vectors of double values ​​as parameters. The two vectors are to be interpreted as coordinates of points, with the first vector containing the x-coordinates and the second vector containing the corresponding y-coordinate at the corresponding index position. The function should determine the parameters a and b of the regression line y=ax+b for the given points and return them to the calling function. Furthermore, the index value of the point that is furthest away from the regression line is to be returned (if there are several points that are equally distant, one of them can be chosen arbitrarily).
If the numbers of x and y coordinates are different, or the regression line cannot be represented in the form ax+b, an exception of type runtime_error must be thrown.
