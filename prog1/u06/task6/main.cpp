/*
Write a function that takes a vector of lottery tickets (each lottery ticket consists of a vector of integers) and the values ​​of the lottery draw (vector of integers) as parameters and returns the number of lottery winnings. In an additional reference parameter, a vector is to be returned that contains the indices of all invalid bets (not exactly six different numbers in the range from 1 to 45 inclusive). If the values ​​passed for the lottery draw are invalid (the same consistency conditions apply as for the bets), an exception of type runtime_error must be thrown. Note: It may be helpful to sort the picks and draw result before starting to look for the sixes.
