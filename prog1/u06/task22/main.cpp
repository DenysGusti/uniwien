/*
(*) Conway's 'Game of Life' consists of an infinite grid of square cells. Each of these cells can assume one of two states: "alive" or "dead". From a given configuration, the "next generation" can be formed according to the following rules:

Any living cell with fewer than 2 living neighboring cells dies from underpopulation
Any living cell with 2 or 3 living neighboring cells survives.
Any living cell with more than 3 living neighboring cells dies from overpopulation
A dead cell with exactly 3 living neighboring cells becomes a living cell (reproduction)
The rules are to be applied to all cells of a generation at the same time in order to get the next generation.

Write a computer program that realizes a finite version of 'Game of Life'. The dimension of the nxm playing field should be determined at the beginning. After that, the living cells of the first generation can be entered and the process is started. The program then outputs the respective successor generations step by step. For the calculation, assume that there are other neighboring cells around the playing field, all of which are dead.
