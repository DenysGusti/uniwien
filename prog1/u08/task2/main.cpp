/*
(+) A car rental company rents cars in economy, normal and luxury classes. The management of the vehicle fleet is to be made easier by a program. The following functions are indispensable: rental (the customer specifies the desired class and is informed of the parking space determined by the program), return (the computer suggests a free parking space and calculates the kilometers driven), decommissioning (the parking spaces of all cars that have exceeded a mileage specified by the user, have to be determined and output by the computer. Since these cars are sold elsewhere, the corresponding parking spaces are also to be regarded as free again from this point in time).

Possible class candidates: Car, Garage
