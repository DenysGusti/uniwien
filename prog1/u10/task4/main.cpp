Write a function that takes an array of int values, the maximum size of the array (i.e. the size with which the array was defined), the length of the array (number of array positions actually occupied with values), an index (insertion position). second array of int values ​​and its length as parameters and inserts all values ​​of the second array into the first at the given insertion position. If the insertion is not possible (because, for example, there is not enough space in the first array or the insertion position is not in the permitted range), an exception must be thrown. A pointer to the first element after the inserted sequence is to be returned. If there is no such element, nullptr is to be returned.
