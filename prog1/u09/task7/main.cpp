/*
Implement a class Matrix to represent matrices over the field R (double values). Overload the +, - (both unary and binary) and * operators with their usual meanings. Operations that cannot be performed must result in an exception being thrown. Also implement a method to transpose a matrix and an operator << to output a matrix in an orderly fashion.

Think about which methods should not make any changes to the this object and define them appropriately as const methods.
