/*
Write a program to control lamps in stage lighting. A total of 32 lamps can be controlled by setting bits in a global unsigned integer variable status. A one means that the corresponding lamp is switched on, a 0 means that the lamp is switched off. Write functions to enable the following actions:

turn off all lights
turn on all lights
turn multiple lights on/off without changing the state of the other lights
reverse the state of all lamps (all lamps that were previously off are turned on and vice versa)
reverse the state of multiple user specified lamps
let the lamps 'move on' a user-specified number of times. This means that if a lamp is switched on/off, the next one/after that/etc. (depending on the number) Lamp gets switched on/off. The lamps are to be thought of as being arranged cyclically, so that the next lamp after the last one is the first again.
