/*
The class Vector is used to represent vectors in R<sup>n</sup>. Implement and test at least the following methods:

Vector::Vector(unsinged n) //creates the null vector in R<sup>n</sup>
Vector::Vector(const vector<double>&) //creates a vector with the appropriate coordinates. The dimension results from the length of the input parameter
Vector Vector::operator+(const Vector&)
Vector Vector::operator-(const Vector&)
double Vector::operator*(const Vector&) //Dot product
Vector Vector::operator/(const Vector&) //Vector product (can only be calculated if both vectors are from R<sup>3</sup>, otherwise an exception is to be thrown; the choice of the operator is rather questionable)
double Vector::norm() //magnitude
(length) void Vector::print()

It should be possible to output vectors in a suitable format using the << operator. Think about which methods should not make any changes to the this object and define them appropriately as const methods.
