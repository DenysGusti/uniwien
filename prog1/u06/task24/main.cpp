/*
(*) Write a function that takes two strings as parameters. The characters in the first string are to be rearranged according to the permutation given in cycle notation in the second string. The number of fixed points must be returned. If the second string does not contain a valid description of a permutation in cycle notation, or if the permutation cannot be applied because the string is too short, an exception of type runtime_error must be thrown. E.g.:
First parameter: "abcdefg" Second parameter "(1 3 4)(5 7)"
Rearranged string: "dbacgfe" Return value: 2
