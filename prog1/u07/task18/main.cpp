/*
(*) The method described in task 17 is very simplified. In practice, the encoded string is saved as a string of characters, with one character being interpreted alternately as a number and the next as the actual character. Since one byte is used in each case, the numbers are limited to a maximum of 256 (0 does not have to be used and you can imagine the numbers shifted accordingly). Longer clusters may need to be split into several groups, e.g. 255a11a for a sequence of 268 'a' characters (the numbers are shown here for clarity only, in reality the corresponding characters are stored in the character string).

Write two functions encode and decode, each of which receives a string as a parameter and transforms it into the encoded or decoded version (the parameter values ​​should be changed directly in place, the functions should not return anything).
