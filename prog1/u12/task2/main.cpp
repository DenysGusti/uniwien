/*
(+) Implement a Transaction class that can be used to store transactions on bank accounts. Each transaction should contain a date, a time, the bank codes and account numbers of the accounts involved, and the amount. The Transaction class should also offer the comparison operators <, == and >, which allow comparing the date of the transaction with a specific key date. So, if tr is a transaction type variable, and the corresponding transaction was performed on 3/5/2023, then tr=="3/5/2023" and tr<"7/1/2023" and tr>"1/1/2023". The comparison operators should also be used to compare the amount of the transaction with any amount, or to compare two transactions (in terms of amount).
