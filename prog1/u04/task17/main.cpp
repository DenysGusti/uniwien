Write a function that takes a string and a character as parameters. The position at which the character first appears in the string is to be returned as an int value. The string may contain parts in double quotation marks that are to be ignored when searching for the character. Think about special cases and how your function should react to them. For example:

Parameters: "He said \"I have no hint.\" and headed south" 'h'
Return value: 30
