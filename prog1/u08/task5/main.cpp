/*
Write a class whose objects each represent a piggy bank. Only coins denominated in 1 cent, 5 cents and 10 cents can be thrown into this piggy bank. Implement at least the methods empty (sets the contents of the piggy bank to 0), insert (allows to insert coins into the piggy bank) and print (returns the contents of the piggy bank in the form "2*1 cents + 1*5 cents+3*10 cents = 37 cents").

Write

the necessary constructors to allow the following definitions of objects (assuming the class is named Piggy):
Piggy a; // creates an empty piggy bank
Piggy b{10}; // creates a piggy bank with 10 cent coins as content
Piggy c{2,3,4}; // creates a piggy bank with 2 cents, 3 nickels and 4 dimes as contents
The comparison operators <, >, ==, !=, each of which compares the contents of two piggy banks
Write a main program that uses at least two instances of your class and illustrates the use of the different methods.
