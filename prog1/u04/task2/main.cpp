/*
Write a function that takes a string and an integer n as parameters and returns the Caesar encoding of the input string. Each character in the input string is to be replaced by its nth successor. The alphabet is thought of as cyclic. If n is e.g. 3, an 'A' becomes a 'D' etc., 'Z' becomes 'C'. Test your function with a main program that repeatedly reads in a string and an integer and outputs the appropriately encoded string until EOF is read, e.g.:

Input: Test 1
Output: Uftu
Input: Zar 2
Output: Bct
Input: Ctrl-D
program end
