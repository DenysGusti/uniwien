(*) Write a function that takes two strings as parameters. Each of the input strings should contain a natural number in decimal notation. A string is to be returned that contains the result of adding the two numbers in decimal notation. However, the strings must not be converted into numbers; rather, the algorithm learned in school for adding two numbers (digit by digit from right to left) must be implemented.

Check that you can correctly add much larger numbers this way than you can in the int data range.
