/*
Write a Set class that can represent subsets of the set {1,2,3,...,32}. The set is to be described by an integer variable, whereby the relevant bit should be set exactly when the set contains a number. For example, if the integer variable has the value 10, the displayed subset is {2,4}. Write the operator methods for +,- and *. Here + should be the set-theoretic union, - the difference and * the intersection. All operators should also work if the right operand is an element (i.e. a number between 1 and 32) and not a set. In this case, the operation is simply performed as if it were a corresponding single-element set, e.g.: Set m; //Empty set m=m+3; // {3} m=m+5; // {3.5} m=m-3; // {5} m*3; // {} m*5; // {5}
