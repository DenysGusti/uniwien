/*
Write a class whose objects represent playing cards. The possible card values ​​are (in ascending order) 10, jack, queen, king and ace. The possible suits (also in ascending order) are spades, clubs, diamonds and hearts. A card trumps if either its suit value is higher, or given equal suits if the card value is higher. Write

the necessary constructors to allow the following definitions of objects (assuming the class is named Card):
Card a; // creates ace of hearts
Card b{jack}; // creates Jack of hearts
Card c{ten, hearts};
The comparison operators <, >, ==, !=, each of which compares two cards. Here a>b if a trumps b according to the above rules.
Write a main program that uses at least two instances of your class and illustrates the use of the different methods.
