(+) A purchasing support program is to be used for a bar. A small number of different spirits are used to produce an equally small number of fixed drinks. The recipes for the drinks are known and no changes in the range are to be expected. The program should provide the following functions: purchase (purchase of spirits), sale (sale of drinks), stock test (issue of all spirits whose stock is below a user-defined quantity) and special sale. During the special sale, a drink that is not listed on the menu is mixed for the customer according to their wishes.
