/*
Write a function that takes an array of strings (C++ strings, not std::string objects) and its length as parameters, and finds which strings occur multiple times in the array. A vector<vector<int>> is to be returned, which combines the indices of the same character strings accordingly. E.g.: Input parameters Array: {"a","b","a","c","a","b"} Length: 6 Return value: {{0,2,4}{1,5}} Character strings that do not appear more than once are not to be taken into account in the result.
