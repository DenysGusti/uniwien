(*) As example 4, different representations however, which result from the application of the commutativity of the addition (e.g. 2+1 and 1+2),
are not to be regarded as different. E.g. for 4:
4
3+1
2+2
2+1+1
1+1+1+1
Note: You can avoid duplicate entries by sorting the summands by size.
The easiest way to enforce this sorting is to only allow summands that are less than or equal to the first summand
in the representations of the remaining difference after the choice of the first summand.
