/*
The class N0 is used to represent natural numbers with an arbitrary number of digits (internal representation as a string). In addition to the value, each object of class N0 also contains a status that determines whether the value represented in the string is valid or not. Implement and test at least the following methods:
N0::N0() // initialize to 0
N0::N0(int)
N0 N0::operator+(N0)
N0 N0::operator-(N0)
N0 N0::operator*(N0)
N0 N0::operator/(N0)
void N0::print()
If overflows occur during the arithmetic operations (+ - * /), an object with the status invalid is returned. The string "invalid" is output for invalid objects.
