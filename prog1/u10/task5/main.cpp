/*
Write a SafePtr class that internally stores a pointer to an int value and also provides operator* to access the referenced value. However, the pointer should be initialized at the beginning (in the constructor) with nullptr and the attempt to dereference nullptr should result in an exception being thrown. To set the internal pointer, operator= must be suitably overloaded with an int pointer as a parameter.
