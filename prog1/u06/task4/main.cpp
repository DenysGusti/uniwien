/*
Write a function that takes as parameters two matrices of integers (data type vector<vector<int>>, corresponds to a vector of rows, which in turn consists of a vector of columns, each with an int value) and returns the product of the two Matrices. If one of the input parameters does not represent a valid matrix (e.g. because the rows are of different lengths) or the product cannot be calculated, a runtime_error type exception must be thrown.
