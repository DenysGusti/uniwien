/*
Implement a Node class. A node contains a single character (char) as information and two pointers (left and right child) to other nodes. Write a print method that interprets the this object as the root of a binary tree and prints the information in the leaf nodes of the tree (those nodes that have no children, so both pointers are nullptr).
Hint: The problem can easily be solved recursively if one observes that there is a recursive definition for a tree: A tree is either empty or a root node on which two other trees are attached.
