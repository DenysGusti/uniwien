/*
Write a function that takes a string and an int value n as parameters and reorders the characters in the string such that a character originally at an index position < n always alternates with a character originally at an index position > = n. If there are different numbers of characters in the two groups, the excess characters must be placed at the end of the string. The number of these excess characters is to be returned. If n is not a valid index position for the string, an excception of type runtime_error must be thrown. E.g.:
string parameters: "abcdefghi" n: 6
rearranged string: "agbhcidef" Return value: 3
