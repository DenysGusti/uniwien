/*
The SafeInt class is used to represent integers. The individual operations are defined in the same way as for the predefined data type int. In contrast to int, SafeInt operations should be secured to a large extent. This means that if the result of a SafeInt operation is not defined (overflow/underflow, division by 0, etc.), the result object should "know" this and take it into account for further operations or an output. Implement and test at least the following methods: SafeInt::SafeInt() // Initialize to 0
SafeInt::SafeInt(int)
SafeInt SafeInt::operator+(SafeInt)
SafeInt SafeInt::operator-(SafeInt)
SafeInt SafeInt::operator*(SafeInt)
SafeInt SafeInt::operator/(SafeInt)
