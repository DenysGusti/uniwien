/*
Write a class whose objects represent rational numbers. The numbers should not be stored in the usual decimal notation (e.g.: 0.33333), but in the form of numerator/denominator (i.e. 1/3). At least implement the methods init (sets the value of the rational number by setting the numerator and denominator), reduce (reduces the represented value to the lowest possible denominator, so that for exampl the representation for 3/9 becomes the equivalent representation 1/3), value (returns the current value of the fraction as a double value) and print (prints the fraction in the form "3/9").
Write

the necessary constructors to allow the following definitions of objects (assuming the class has the name Q):
Q a; // creates a rational number with the value zero
Q b{10}; // creates a rational number with a value of 10
Q c{1,2}; // creates a rational number with the value 0.5
The +, -, *, and / operators, which add, subtract, multiply, and divide rational numbers, respectively
Write a main program that uses at least two instances of your class and illustrates the use of the different methods.
