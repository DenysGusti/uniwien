'run length encoding' is a simple compression technique for texts in which characters appear frequently. The individual characters are replaced by a combination of number and characters, e.g.: aaaaaabbbbbaaaaaaabbbbcc -> 6a5b7a4b2c

Implement a struct that can store the count and a character and write a function that takes a string as an input parameter and returns a vector of struct elements containing the encoding of the input string.
