/*
Write a function that takes two arrays of double values ​​as parameters and returns an array of double values.
The returned vector should always alternately contain a value from the first parameter and a value from the second parameter
(starting with the first value from the first parameter).
The relative order of the values ​​should be the same in the result vector as in the input vectors.
If the two input vectors are of different lengths, the remainder of the longer vector must be appended to the result without being changed. E.g.:

Parameters:	  	            Result:
{1,2,3}{4,5,6}		        {1,4,2,5,3,6}
{1,2,3,4,5,6}{7,8,9}		{1,7,2,8,3,9,4,5,6}
Don't use loops in the function.
