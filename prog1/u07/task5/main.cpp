/*
Palindromes are words (or phrases) that read the same from left to right as from right to left. A well-known example is the name "Otto". This can also be applied to numbers: for example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not. For numbers, the "palindrome" property is of course dependent on the chosen base. For example, the number 15 in binary (1111) is a palindrome, but not in decimal. Write two functions bool pal10(unsigned) and bool pal2(unsigned) that determine whether the input parameter is a palindrome in the decimal system (pal10) or in the binary system (pal2). Do not use multiplication (*,*=) or division (/,/=) in the pal2 function.
