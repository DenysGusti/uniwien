Write a function that takes a string (lowercase only) as a parameter and returns a string with the first character of the input string sorted alphabetically correctly. This means that all characters that are smaller than the original first character should appear first, then this first character and finally the characters that are greater than (or the same as) the original first character, e.g.:

input string: keinblasserschimmer
returned string (other solutions are also possible): eibaechieknlssrsmmr
