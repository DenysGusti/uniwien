(*) Write a circle method for the Link class of Example 6 that determines whether the chain that starts from this object contains a circle (that is, as you traverse the links along the pointers, you'll eventually return to a previously visited one chain link comes back). Accordingly, true (if a circle was found) or false is to be returned.
