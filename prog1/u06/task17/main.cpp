In the 8 queens problem, 8 queens must be positioned on a chessboard in such a way that they do not threaten each other. Write a program to help find a solution. It should be possible to position queens on the field by entering the field coordinates in the usual chess notation. If the selected position is threatened, the program should issue a message. Otherwise a queen is placed in that position. The entry can be repeated until 8 queens have been positioned.
