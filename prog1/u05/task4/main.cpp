/*
(*) Write a function that takes a positive number n as a parameter and returns all the different ways of representing the number
as a sum of positive numbers. For example, for input 4, the following should be output:
4
3+1
2+2
2+1+1
1+3
1+2+1
1+1+2
1+1+1+1
Hint: Any positive number smaller than n can be chosen as the first summand.
The possible cumulative representations with this first summand are exactly the possible cumulative representations of the remaining difference.
E.g.: If n is equal to 4 and one chooses the first summand 1, then the difference is 3. For 3 there are the possibilities 3, 2+1, 1+2 and 1+1+1.
4 can be represented with 1 as the first addend in the four ways 1+3, 1+2+1, 1+1+2 and 1+1+1+1.
